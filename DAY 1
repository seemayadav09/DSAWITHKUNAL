after compilation each individual class is converted into a .class file which is known as byte code.
JVM(Java virtual machine) is used to run the byte code
Whitespace, including spaces and newlines, between statements is ignored.
In Java, a statement is a line of code that executes a task and is terminated with a ;


// Creating a String variable
String name = "Bob";

// The following will print "false" because strings are case-sensitive
System.out.println(name.equals("bob"));

int age = 28; 

char grade = 'A';

boolean late = true;

byte b = 20;

long num1 = 1234567;

short no = 10;

float k = (float)12.5;

double pi = 3.14;
